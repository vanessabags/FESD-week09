                    This is an assignment. I shall continue this paragraph with random text. Pineapple on pizza is a weird stance because some people take this preference too seriously.
                    Personally, I like pineapple pizza, especially with ham, because you get sweet and savory. Anyways, you will see a lot of random information about me in this assignment.

                    <p>One of my favorite quotes by my father: Made in the Philippines. Born in Hawai'i. While totally explainable and straightforward, it is not just funny but it reminds me of the fact that 
                        for a long time my family was separated. My father lived away from his family for multiple years either for work in a different country or because he was the last one to move to the US and get a green card. 
                        But either way, it is funny to think about and to say.

                        Another paragraph for funsies. Or rant? I do not know much about inflation but I do know that in middle school I would go with my friends to McDonald's after school and the price of large fries was $2.59. 
                        But if you look up the prices today, you will find that small fires cost $2.89. And when you think about the size difference, inflation has made it more than doubled. French fries are so delicious. 
                        At this point, everyone should just take the time and buy frozen french fries from the store. But then you will definitely eat more than twice the size of a McDonald's large fries - maybe three times the size. 
                        French fries! French fries!
